Folder description:
# homogeneous
Simulated solutions for both the one and two species model in the homogeneous case.
# nonHomogeneous1Species
Simulated and numerical solutions for the one species model in the non homogeneous case.
# nonHomogeneous2Species
Simulated and numerical solutions for the two species model in the non homogeneous case. 

Simulated solutions are obtained with the Monte Carlo algorithm.
Numerical solutions are obtained combining a finite difference method in space and implicit or explicit methods in time. 

# predatorPrey
# simula
Simulated solutions for the predator prey model, obtained with the Monte Carlo algorithm.
# twoD
Two dimensional predator prey model
# regularity
Compute the regularity values as the parameters changes. 
# oscillations
Signals with and without noise.
